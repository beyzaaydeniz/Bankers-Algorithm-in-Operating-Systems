The Banker’s algorithm operates by considering the available resources, the resource needs of each process, and the currently allocated resources. It performs a safety check to determine if granting the requested resources to a process would result in a safe state. A safe state means that all processes can eventually complete their execution without encountering a deadlock. 
In this project, I dynamically allocated 2 single linked list to keep completed processes and deadlock processes. I implemented a recursive  insert” function to add process (node) to completed or deadlock lists. I implemented 2 functions to check safety of the system. ”isSafe” function takes process number as a parameter and checks safety of this process. In isSafeState function takes no parameter and checks safety for each processes using isSafe function. Even if there is only one safe process, the system is considered safe. Both this functions return bool. If isSafeState function returns true, this means that system is safe. While system is in safe state, every process is again checked with isSafe function and if it returns true, ”runProcess” is ran and that running process is inserted in completed list.
